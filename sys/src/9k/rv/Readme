The attached .tgz file should have everything you need to compile Plan
9 riscv64 kernels and commands.  I plan to continue improving the port
and adapting to other RISC-V systems.

Note the documentation and manual pages.  The compilers are ic (rv32)
and jc (rv64), built from the same sources.  Note that I've widened
the last argument to memset to be uintptr (but this is *not* required,
you can choose not to).

Set ARCH to the desired RISC-V architecture.  "mk subarchs" will list them.
The "te" architecture is tinyemu.  mk will generate 9tecpu.bin files that
can be executed directly by our modified tinyemu.  On hardware, interrupt
u-boot and type

	dhcp 0x90000000; bootm 0x90000000 - ${fdtcontroladdr}

to load ndb's

	bootf=/riscv64/9pfcpu.uim

booting(8) has all the details.

All these kernels are cpu kernels; the only peripherals supported so far are
uarts, ethernet, sd and mmc cards.

Almost everything I have tried has worked (gs, of course, never really works
right).

Good luck, and let me know if you have questions.
