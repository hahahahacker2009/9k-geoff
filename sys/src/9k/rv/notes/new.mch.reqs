look for these in a new machine:

- thorough English documentation, including ethernet registers & descriptors
- u-boot with pxe
- cache and dma coherence
- serial console via usb connector, not gpio pins
- robust against i/o register probes and ram probes
- kernel isn't required to enable zillions of clock signals
- straight-forward reset, sbi or another
- case with cooling
