working:
milk-v jupiter	works. seems like it should be faster.  no 2nd ethernet.
polarfire icicle works well except no pxe autoboot.  fix: newer u-boot.
premier p550	works. seems like it should be faster.
tinyemu		works, single core, sv48 or sv39, M mode, no sbi, no u-boot.
unmatched	works
visionfive 2	works

discontinued:
beagle v	works, modulo hw bugs.

hopeless:
rvb-ice		wedges or ill. inst. after starting paging.  u-boot "go"
		starts in M mode.  can't find how linux works.  buggy CPU.
		mine has broken ethernet.
