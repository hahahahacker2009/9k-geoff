Several things are needed early in system start up, and they often
have circular dependencies:

- interrupts off
- on a risc, set static base register
- park secondary cpus
- zeroed bss
- set up stack for function calls.  can probably call C now.
- printing, maybe by uart, for debugging, including formatted output
	- should work even before malloc does
- timed delays for drivers
- mmu on for paging, initially with low identity map & KZERO->0 high map.
	also, map device registers uncached into high kernel space.
- size memory
- set up malloc
- prepare for interrupts
- start clock interrupts
- call C if not already in C
