This directory contains a port of the Plan 9 9k kernel to 64-bit
RISC-V systems, specifically RV64GC systems.  It runs on the Microchip
Polarfire Icicle, Starfive Visionfive 2, Milk-v Jupiter, Sifive Hifive
Unmatched, Sifive Premier 550, and discontinued and pre-release Beagle
V boards, and should be relatively easy to adapt to future RV64GC
systems.  SiFive designs have worked best.

The Nezha board's u-boot lacks PXE booting, so it's a non-starter.  An
RVB-ICE port is abandoned; its Xuantie C910 CPU is incompatible in a
few respects, and buggy, plus the Ethernet controller on mine broke.
You may find debugging code, particularly at start-up, mostly tagged
with "c910".

Set the ARCH environment variable to the target RISC-V architecture
(e.g., "pf" for Icicle, "um" for Unmatched) before invoking mk.
"mk subarchs" will list them.

It's a good idea to read ../doc/*.pdf.

The minimum ISA specifications assumed are 2.22 for unprivileged (user mode)
and 1.10 for privileged (kernel).

To print KZERO and the reboot trampoline base address (RBKTZERO) for the
current ARCH,

	mk -f kzmkfile
