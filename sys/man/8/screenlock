.SH DIAGNOSTICS
Per
.BR BUGS ,
a missing
.L role=server
attribute makes
.I screenlock
misleadingly report a password mismatch.
.SH BUGS
Use of this program on communal terminals is anti-social.
.PP
.I Screenlock
uses
.IR auth_userpasswd ,
which requires a
.L role=server
attribute in a
.I factotum
entry for the invoking user.
This requirement may be a mistake.
